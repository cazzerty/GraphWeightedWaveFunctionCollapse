# Graph-Weighted Wave Function Collapse
 
This repository contains a Unity implementation of an experimental extension to the wave function collapse algorithm in which each cell collapse is impacted by proximity to a weighted graph. The goal of modifying the algorithm in such a way was to allow for greater control over map generation, such that a general structure could be guaranteed.
